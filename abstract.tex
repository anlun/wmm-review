Memory model defines the semantics of 
concurrent programs operating on shared memory.
The main trade-off in the design of a memory model
is between programmability and optimization opportunities.
Stronger models, like sequential consistency, 
provide simpler and more predictable semantics,
but have to abandon certain hardware and compiler optimizations,
while weaker models enable many optimizations 
at the cost of less intuitive semantics.  

In recent years a plenty of memory models for 
various programming languages were proposed, 
which made various compromises with respect 
to programmability versus optimization opportunities.
In this paper we present a survey of these models,
classify them, and discuss their properties and limitations.
